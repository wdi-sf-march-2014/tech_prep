## Floral Problems


You are a florist and you have different amounts of flowers each day. Typically you have Begonias, Gardenias, and Petunias that someone will drop off in batches in the shop. There is never a consistent amount of each flower.

For example, part of a typical week might look like the folllowing:

|	| Begonias | Gardenias | Petunias |
|:--	| :---		| :----		|	:---	|
| Monday | 		24 		| 	18		 | 36 |
| Tuesday | 	20		|  16 	|	12 |
| Wednesday |  21 |		18	|	24	|
| Thursday	|	18	|	32	| 20 |	

You want to make as many bouquets as possible each day, but it's **very** important that each bouqet has the same amount of each flower every day, whithout any left over flowers.

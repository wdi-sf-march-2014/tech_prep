## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is an old sequence that has many popular connections.

It looks like the following

    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

> Note: how `5` is `2+3`, `3` is `1+2`, and `2` is `1+1`.

The only numbers that do not follow this pattern are the first two numbers `1,1`, which are then used to generate the following numbers in the sequence.

Implement a recursive method that gives the Fibonacci sequence at the `n-th` position in the sequence for some `n`.

For example:

    Fibonacci(6) => 8
    Fibonacci(1) => 1
    Fibonacci(2) => 1
    Fibonacci(3) => 2

## Compression


After working with random strings of text all day in your office you start to wonder if there is an easier way to store the text. What you end up with is an idea for compression that you want to implement. You decided to replace repeated characters with their count followed by the character, i.e. `AAAABBBCD` becomes `4A3BCD`.
